        The map above is a political map of the world centered on Europe and Africa. 
        It shows the location of most of the world's countries and includes their names where space allows.
        Representing a round earth on a flat map requires some distortion of the geographic features no matter how the map is done. We have used a Mercator projection for this map because it is the projection most commonly used in schools.
        On this map, geographic boundaries that trend north-south appear as vertical lines, geographic boundaries that trend east-west appear as horizontal lines. 
        This type of projection causes a minimum of country-shape distortion near the equator, a small amount of distortion at mid-latitudes, but extreme distortion near the poles. For that reason, the map does not extend to the north and south poles.

                <strong>Australia </strong>(Oceania) is the smallest continent on Earth and is home to only .3% of the population of the Earth. It is also called Oceania to differentiate between the country Australia and the continent named Australia. The largest city in Oceania is Sydney, Australia with a population of 4.9 million people.

                A lot of the country Australia is uninhabited by humans, but it does have a massive amount of unique plants and animals. Living in Australia is not for the faint of heart with its large desert and scary insects.

                It is extremely cold, with the temperature ranging between -110 degrees Fahrenheit to 50 degrees Fahrenheit (at the northernmost coast during the summer).

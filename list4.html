                The first and foremost function of a legislature is to legislate i.e. to make laws.
                In ancient times, laws used to be either derived from customs, traditions and religious scriptures, or
                were issued by the kings as their commands.

                It is the legislature which formulates the will of the state into laws and gives it a legal character.

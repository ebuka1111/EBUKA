        <dd>The respiratory system (also respiratory apparatus, ventilatory system) is a biological system consisting of specific organs and structures used for gas exchange in animals and plants.</dd>
        <dd> The lung provides the tissues of the human body with a continuous flow of oxygen and clears the blood of the gaseous waste product, carbon dioxide</dd>

        <dd>The reproductive system of an organism, also known as the genital system, is the biological system made up of all the anatomical organs involved in sexual reproduction.</dd>
        <dd>During copulation, a male gamete sperm enters the fallopian tube and fuses with a female gamete ovum, leading to a formation of a diploid zygote. 
        <strong> <em>The cells of the zygote divide repeatedly</em> </strong> as the zygote moves down the fallopian tube to the uterus. The formed embryo implants to the wall of the uterus and grows in the uterus during pregnancy.</dd>
